Return Risk Predictor and Smart Substitute Recommender
This project aims to reduce product return rates and improve customer satisfaction by predicting the likelihood of returns for each product and recommending lower-risk alternatives at the point of purchase. Designed for the Walmart Sparkathon 2025, this solution leverages machine learning and data-driven decision-making to improve user experience and optimize Walmart's retail efficiency.

Problem Statement
Product returns represent a major challenge for Walmart, leading to increased logistics costs, inventory inefficiencies, and reduced customer trust. Many returns are preventable, driven by issues such as inconsistent sizing, misleading product descriptions, or quality concerns.

This project focuses on addressing this challenge by:

Identifying products with a high probability of being returned before purchase.

Recommending lower-risk, better-reviewed alternatives.

Explaining risk factors to help users make informed decisions.

Key Features
Return risk score generated using machine learning models

Real-time product evaluation during checkout

Automated product substitution engine based on risk and quality metrics

Explanation module highlighting probable return reasons

Simulated Walmart product catalog with cart functionality

Architecture Overview
Frontend: React (TypeScript)

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost (for risk prediction)

Data Layer: Simulated product and review datasets (CSV or Firebase)

Deployment: [Insert deployment platform, e.g., Vercel, Render, etc.]

How It Works
A user selects a product and adds it to their cart.

The backend model computes the return probability based on:

Average product rating

Review volume

Category and price

NLP-based sentiment from reviews

Historical return rates (simulated)

If the return probability exceeds a defined threshold:

A warning message is displayed

Alternative products with better satisfaction metrics are suggested

The user can choose a substitute or proceed with their original selection.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/return-risk-predictor.git
cd return-risk-predictor
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
By default, the frontend is served on http://localhost:3000 and the backend on http://localhost:8000.

Dataset Details
The project uses a simulated dataset that includes:

product_id, name, brand, category

price, average_rating, review_count

return_rate (simulated)

text-based review samples for optional NLP processing

You can extend this with open datasets or Walmart product metadata for more accurate results.

Future Improvements
Integrate Walmartâ€™s live inventory and review APIs

Add personalization based on user return history and purchase behavior

Apply explainable AI (e.g., SHAP values) to clarify why an item is flagged

Expand product substitution logic to include bundle suggestions
